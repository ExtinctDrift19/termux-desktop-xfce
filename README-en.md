# What is it?

This is an advanced configuration of termux x11, rich in features to be highly functional, 
good looking, highly customizable and with very good optimization, this was inspired by

> few apps ?, I have made a configuration to run the apps of a proot distro in termux x11! An example:

./start-ubuntu.sh

apt install firefox

export DISPLAY=:1

firefox 

### can run proot apps without problems
